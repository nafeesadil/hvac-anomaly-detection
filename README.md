# 🏢 HVAC System Optimization using Sensor Data

This project focuses on optimizing HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) systems using time-series sensor data stored in InfluxDB. The work is part of my master's thesis and includes data labeling, anomaly detection, and interactive visualization.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- ✅ Label data based on system behavior (e.g., **Operating Hours**)
- ✅ Apply machine learning (e.g., **Isolation Forest**) for anomaly detection
- ✅ Build a **Streamlit GUI** for interaction and visualization
- ✅ Enable reusability of the ML pipeline for multiple labels and thresholds
